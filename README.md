# Better Dark Mode Chrome Extension
Gives pages a better dark mode by avoiding things like full white text on full black test which isn't really much better on the eyes.

# Notes:
- Inverts colors/background-color/border-color for every element on page.
- Does not allow any RGB values below 50 or above 200

# Upcoming
- Better active/inactive state storage (currently using localStorage)
- Allow choosing RGB max and min threshhold
